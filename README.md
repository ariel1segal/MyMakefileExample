# MyMakefileExample
This is a demonstration of my Makefile at work.

The advantege of this Make file is, that I do not need to list the source code files of the project, and another important advantege is, that it automatically resolves dependencies. I do however need to list the include paths.
This make file assumes a perticular directory arrangement. The working directory is on the top, and under it to would find the ‘src’ directory and the ‘bin’ directory.
